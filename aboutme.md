title: About me

---

My name is Chirag Kaudan, I'm a PhD student at Oregon State studying theoretical computer science, most interested in combinatorial problems, algorithms, and complexity theory. I like to think about things and most of my thoughts aren't very good, but sometimes I have the urge to share some thoughts with other people, but they are far too long to read in text messages. So I created this blog, enjoy your time here!
